    Geography (from Greek: γεωγραφία, geographia, literally "earth description") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of Earth.
</p>
<p>
Geography is a systematic study of the Earth, its features, and phenomena that take place on it. 
For something to fall into the domain of geography, it generally needs some sort of spatial component that can be placed on a map, such as coordinates, place names, or addresses. 
This has led to geography being associated with cartography and place names. Although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology, this is not their main preoccupation. 
Geographers study the Earth's spatial and temporal distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment.
 Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as economics, health, climate, plants, and animals, geography is highly interdisciplinary. 
 The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and their spatial patterns.
  Geography is specific to the planet Earth, and other celestial bodies are specified, such as "geography of Mars," or given another name, such as areography in the case of Mars.

Names of places...are not geography...To know by heart a whole gazetteer full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a geographer.
 Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. 
This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. 
In a word, Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.<br>

— William Hughes, 1863</b><br>
Just as all phenomena exist in time and thus have a history, they also exist in space and have a geography.<br>
<b>
— United States National Research Council, 1997</b><br>
Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into three main subsidiary fields: human geography, physical geography, 
and technical geography.
 Human geography largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space.
  Physical geography examines the natural environment, and how organisms, climate, soil, water, and landforms produce and interact.
  The difference between these approaches led to the development of integrated geography, which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.
   Technical geography involves studying and developing the tools and techniques used by geographers, such as remote sensing, cartography, and geographic information system.
